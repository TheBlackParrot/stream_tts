I'm sick and tired of people using "mid" to describe things that are just plain bad! Like seriously, have they forgotten what the word actually means? It's all about mediocrity, not utter garbage. Back in the day, "mid" used to refer to stuff that was average or meh, nothing special. But now, people are throwing it around like it's a synonym for "trash" or "terrible!" It's like they can't handle the concept of something just being okay or average anymore! Everything's either amazing or complete crap. No in between.
